This file contains some hints how mex file generation for Matlab could work.
We cannot guarantee that the proposed methods work on your system. 

Mex file generation for Octave is described in the bensolve tools reference manual.

** LINUX and MACOS **

Install GLPK.
At the matlab command line, run:

mex CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -std=c99 -O3"  -lglpk -largeArrayDims -output bensolve src/bslv_algs.c src/bslv_lists.c src/bslv_lp.c src/bslv_main.c src/bslv_poly.c src/bslv_vlp.c
	
If glpk.h is not found, you can specify its location (here /usr/local/include):
	
mex CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -std=c99 -O3" -I/usr/local/include -lglpk -largeArrayDims -output bensolve src/bslv_algs.c src/bslv_lists.c src/bslv_lp.c src/bslv_main.c src/bslv_poly.c src/bslv_vlp.c

** WINDOWS **

INSTALLING MINGW AND SETTING IT AS MEX COMPILER

Install a version of the MinGW compiler for Windows:
1. Download TDC-GCC 5.1.0 (MinGW compiler) e.g. from http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download
2. Install TDC-GCC in the default location (C:\TDM-GCC-64 or C:\TDM-GCC-32)
//Set this compiler as mex compiler in Matlab
3. Download the latest Gnumex version e.g. from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnumex/files/
4. Unpack the downloaded zip-archive in a place of your choice, run Matlab and move to the gnumex directory
5. Run gnumex.m
6. A window pops up, set (C:\TDM-GCC-64 or C:\TDM-GCC-32) as MinGW root directory and press "make options file"
7. If an orange warning message occurs, follow the instructions
8. Type "mex -setup" into your matlab command prompt, you should be able to choose a compiler called gcc in "C:\TDM-GC~1\bin" by typing the associated number 

COMPILING 

Download GLPK and generate a static library (the toolbox uses the glpk library):
1. Download GLPK 4.60 from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/
2. Unzip and store the GLPK folder anywhere you wish
3. Create the files "Build_GLPK_with_MinGW.bat" ,  "config_MinGW" and "makefile_MinGW" in the w64/w32 subdirectory of your GLPK directory according to https://gist.github.com/andrewandrepowell/ddd5e99a52a0b8a26ebc305d42898226
4. Run "Build_GLPK_with_MinGW.bat" (double click it)
5. You obtain a libglpk.a file, copy it into the "src" directory of the bensolve tools
//Compile the program
6. Copy the 'glpk.h' file from the glpk folder in "src"
7. Change your Matlab working directory to the bensolve tools directory
8. Run the following command in the Matlab prompt: mex src/bslv_algs.c src/bslv_lists.c src/bslv_lp.c src/bslv_main.c src/bslv_poly.c src/bslv_vlp.c -largeArrayDims -output bensolve  CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -std=c99"  -I'src' src\libglpk.a 

Remark: If you want to use another glpk version, make sure to make the appropriate changes in makefile_MinGW
